# Explain

Buying on day1 at P1 selling on day3 at P3 gets us P3-P1 profits. This is equal to buying on day1 selling on day2 buy again on day2 and selling on day3 which gives us a profit of (P3-P2)+(P2-P1). From this example we see that we can do a transaction between each two days and merely remove the ones that give us negative profits and the resulting total profit should be the maximum we can get. Further explained, this is equal to adding together all the positive profits between a day and the next.

# Solution

 ```CPP
 class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int result=0;
        for(int i=0; i<prices.size()-1; i++){
            result+=max(prices[i+1]-prices[i], 0);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
 ```
