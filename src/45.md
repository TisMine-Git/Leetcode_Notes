# Explain  
Similar to [quesiton 55](55.md) but here we need the shortest jumps.
To acheive min jumps, we should always jump from the index that leads us farthest (note this is not jumping to an index that leads us farthest)  

Interestingly, we do not need to know where exactly we should jump from, but instead which index this jump would lead us to (the current *max_reach*).  

For example, we are currently at index i which lets us jump a maximum of 3 steps to i+3. We can move one index at a time and update the *max_reach*. When we reach i+3 and we are still not at the end, we must do another jump (*jumps ++*). We do not need to know where we should jump from but we know for sure that this jump should enable us to reach any index from i+3 to *max_reach*. Repeat this process until our *max_reach* is not smaller than the last index which indicates the next jump would certainly be the last jump.

# Solution

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int max_reach=0;
        int jumps=0;
        int prev=0;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size()-1; i++){
            max_reach=max(i+nums[i], max_reach);
            if(i==prev){
                jumps++;
                prev=max_reach;
                if(max_reach>=nums.size()-1){
                    break;
                }   
            }
        }
        return jumps;
    }
};
```
